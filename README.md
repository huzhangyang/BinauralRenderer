# BinauralRenderer
A real-time binaural renderer plugin for Unity and Unreal Engine in 64bit Windows OS, also my MSc research project.

Dependency:
FMOD for audio I/O.
MATLAB for HRTF data I/O.
FFTW for convolution operation.

This is a Visual Studio 2017 project. FMOD and FFTW is shipped, you need to specify a valid MATLAB install location to use.
